# Holon World Constraints

This document defines the strict security, operational, and lifecycle constraints for the Holon Agentic Coder
environment. Violating these constraints triggers automated alerts, sandbox terminations, or trust degradation.

## 1. Git Flow & Branch Constraints

- **Prefix-Based Isolation:** Every active task must run inside its own isolated branch prefix:
  - **Root Intents:** `I-{timestamp}-{slug}/_`. Only human operators can approve merges to the canonical `main` branch.
  - **Plan Variants:** `I-{timestamp}-{slug}/P-{timestamp}-{agent}-{model}/_`. Created off of the intent branch.
  - **Execution Runs:** `I-{timestamp}-{slug}/P-{timestamp}-{agent}-{model}/E-{timestamp}-{action}/_`. Created off of
    the plan branch.
- **Rebase Discipline:** Before any execution run or branch merge, the working branch must be rebased from its parent
  branch to prevent divergence.
- **Commit Boundaries:** Code changes must be scoped strictly to the current active step and git branch. Agents are
  prohibited from checking out or committing directly to `main` or other intents' branches.

## 2. Sandbox Containment Tiers

All execution and validation activities must run inside an isolated sandbox determined by predicted entropy and agent
trust:

1. **Process Sandbox:** (Low entropy $< 10$, high trust). Local Python sub-process with filesystem containment and
   disabled network access.
2. **Container Sandbox (Docker):** (Medium entropy $10 - 30$, standard trust). Docker container with resource
   constraints (max 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM) and complete network isolation.
3. **VM Sandbox:** (High entropy $> 30$, low/baseline trust). Highly secure VM with kernel-level isolation and rollback
   support.

- **Escape Actions:** Any attempt to spawn unwhitelisted subprocesses, modify read-only directories, execute privilege
  escalation, or access external networks will trigger immediate sandbox termination, trust level degradation, and
  escalation to human operators.

## 3. Ledger Immutability

- **Append-Only Ledger:** The ledgers located at `holon-knowledge/ledger/` (`intents.jsonl`, `plans.jsonl`,
  `events.jsonl`) are immutable.
- **Zero Modification Policy:** Removing, rewriting, amending, or editing historical lines in `.jsonl` files is strictly
  prohibited. Only append operations are allowed.

---

## 4. Model Routing Constraints

- **Exploration vs. Safety:** Routing is dictated by predicted plan entropy and novelty:
  - **Flash Models:** Recommended for routine tasks, boilerplate implementations, and simple tests.
  - **Deep Models:** Mandated for refactoring core modules, security-sensitive plans, or intents exceeding an entropy
    threshold of $20$.
