# Intents Directory

This directory is used for drafting local intent configuration files (`*.json`) on your host machine before executing
them in the sandboxed Docker environment.

> [!NOTE] This directory is added to `.gitignore` to prevent draft configurations from being committed. The official,
> permanent ledger of executed intents is automatically saved and committed inside the repository at
> `holon-knowledge/ledger/intents.jsonl`.

## Schema for `intent.json`

Every intent configuration file must be a JSON object with the following fields:

- **`branch`** (string, optional): The target branch name (e.g., `I-1771890389-refactor-metrics`). If omitted, it will
  be automatically generated on the fly as `I-{timestamp}-{slug}`.
- **`slug`** (string, required if `branch` is omitted): A short URL-safe identifier for the task.
- **`description`** (string, optional): A high-level description of what changes are being made.
- **`goal`** (string, optional): The target objective or test criteria.
- **`target_branch`** (string, optional): The base branch to check out and fork the new branch from (e.g. `develop`). If
  omitted, defaults to `main`.

### Example (`intents/refactor-metrics.json`)

```json
{
  "slug": "refactor-metrics",
  "description": "Clean up metrics estimators and configuration structure",
  "goal": "Refactor local metrics calculations to reduce entropy",
  "target_branch": "develop"
}
```

## How to Run

To run the Intent Creator with an intent draft from this directory, run the following Docker command from the repository
root:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e HOLON_ROLE=intent-creator \
  -e GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
  -v "$(pwd)/intents/your-intent-file.json:/tmp/intent.json" \
  -v ~/.ssh:/home/holon/.ssh:ro \
  holon/orchestrator
```

## Nested JSON Limitation & Workarounds

When defining intents that require structured JSON or code blocks inside fields like `goal` or `description`, nesting
raw JSON inside a JSON string is syntactically invalid (it must be escaped as a string), leading to ugly escaping
friction (e.g. `\"`).

Here are the standard workarounds:

### Workaround 1: YAML Drafts (Recommended)

You can write your local drafts in YAML (`intent.yaml`), which natively supports clean, unescaped multi-line strings and
nested structures:

```yaml
slug: "config-setup"
goal: |
  Deploy the naive config:
  {
    "port": 8080,
    "debug": true
  }
```

_Note: If using this workaround, the host CLI wrapper converts the YAML config to `/tmp/intent.json` on the fly before
mounting it into the container._

### Workaround 2: External File Reference

Store the nested JSON in a separate file (e.g., `intents/payload.json`) and reference its path:

```json
{
  "slug": "config-setup",
  "goal": "Deploy configuration defined in external file",
  "payload_ref": "./payload.json"
}
```

### Workaround 3: Base64 Encoding

Encode the inner JSON string into Base64 to bypass all syntax and character escaping constraints:

```json
{
  "slug": "config-setup",
  "goal": "eyogICJwb3J0IjogODA4MCwKICAiZGVidWciOiB0cnVlCn0="
}
```

### Workaround 4: Standard String Escaping

For very simple payloads, use escaped strings:

```json
{
  "slug": "config-setup",
  "goal": "Deploy config: {\"port\": 8080, \"debug\": true}"
}
```
